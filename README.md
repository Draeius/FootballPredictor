# FootballPredictor
 
This neural network is designed to predict football (soccer) games by feeding it fifa player data.

There are two attempts wich are currently effective to variing degrees.

The Data is scraped from the internet, which has to be done beforehand.

# Vectors

One is converting the games into vectors of integers and then trained. This has an accuracy of about 50%, depending on the training, which is 20% better than just choosing random.

# Images

The second one is trained using images, that contain the information given. This is currently no better than guessing randomly and needs further tweeking.
